## Walker
Walker is an application for creating, tracking, and modifying goals for health-related walking. Users set an initial goal and track their progress. Walker's algorithms suggest new goals going forward.

### Reasons for developing Walker
My primary reason for writing Walker is because I want to use it. I've been walking for health for the past four years, metering my steps, and tracking them using increasingly-complicated Google spreadsheets. This application is meant to replace those spreadsheets and add to their functionality.

My secondary reason for writing Walker is to see how far I can push an application that exists entirely inside the browser. Walker is written entirely in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and uses Firebase as its back-end. There is no server code.
