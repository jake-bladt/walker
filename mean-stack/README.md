## Walker
Walker is an application for creating, tracking, and modifying goals for health-related walking. Users set an initial goal and track their progress. Walker's algorithms suggest new goals going forward.

### Reasons for developing Walker
My primary reason for writing Walker is because I want to use it. I've been walking for health for the past four years, metering my steps, and tracking them using increasingly-complicated Google spreadsheets. This application is meant to replace those spreadsheets and add to their functionality.

My secondary reason for writing Walker is to fully explore the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node) and improve my overall JavaScript chops.
